			 Amr Diab was born on 11 October 1961 in [[Port Said]], Egypt into an artistic family. His father, Abdul Basset Diab, worked for the Suez Canal Corporation and was the chairman of Marine Construction Shipbuilding in the Canal. Diab's father played a huge role in igniting the early sparks of musical inspiration towards Diab's early stages in his professional music career. Diab, at the age of six, had his first shot at fame when he sang the [[Egypt|Egyptian National Anthem]] "[[Bilady, Bilady, Bilady]]" at the annual 23 July Festival in Port Said. As a result, he was rewarded with a guitar from the governor of Port Said, and began to become recognised nationally. <br>Diab graduated with a bachelor's degree in Arabic Music from the Cairo Academy of Arts in 1986

		ردى عليك مابقاش حايفيدك ضعت وضيعتنى من ايدك 
		ياخسارة بتيجى الحاجه لما الواحد ما يعوزهاش 
		مش ناسى كلامك فى وداعنا ولا قسوة قلبك و عينيك
		 كنت بقولك خليك جنبى ماتهزتش و هنت عليك 
		 بقى مش عارف ايه غيرنى يا برىء يا حنين يا ملاك 
		 حابعد علشان بتفكرنى بالجرح اللى انا عشته معاك
